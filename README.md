Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Flask enthusiast who loves to build web applications using Python. I have experience in developing RESTful APIs, authentication systems, data visualization tools and more. I also enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks that can enhance my skills and projects.

Some of the tools and technologies I use are:

- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Jinja2
- Bootstrap
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Heroku
- Git/Github

I'm currently working on some private projects that I hope to share soon. In the meantime, you can check out some of my stats and badges below:
